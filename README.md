## Features:

- 1 player vs the computer, OR
- 2 player (human vs human)
- Added explosion sound effect
- Enhanced title/options screen
- Instructions screen

## Instructions:

The gameplay is very simple, and instructions are in the game, but here is a brief overview:

Players take turns to place a bomb in the playfield (grid).
Whenever any square reaches 'critical mass', it explodes and sends its bombs
into neighboring squares. Any bombs in these squares are then 'captured', and may in turn 
reach critical mass.

This can create a 'chain reaction' that can spread across the playfield.

The goal of the game is to eliminate all of your opponent's bombs from the play grid."


## Possible future enhancements:
- 3 or 4 player option?
- Better sound effects?
- Better visual effects
